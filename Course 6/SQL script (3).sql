--Refining your Results
--Exercise 1: String Patterns
--Retrieve all employees whose address is in Elgin,IL.
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE ADDRESS LIKE '%Elgin,IL%';

--Retrieve all employees who were born during the 1970's.
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE B_DATE LIKE '197%';

--Retrieve all employees in department 5 whose salary is between 60000 and 70000.
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES 
WHERE DEP_ID = 5 AND SALARY BETWEEN 60000 AND 70000;

--Exercise 2: Sorting
--Retrieve a list of employees ordered by department ID.
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES 
ORDER BY DEP_ID;

--Retrieve a list of employees ordered in descending order by department ID and within each department ordered alphabetically in descending order by last name.
SELECT F_NAME, L_NAME, DEP_ID FROM EMPLOYEES 
ORDER BY DEP_ID DESC, L_NAME DESC;

--In SQL problem 2 (Exercise 2 Problem 2), use department name instead of department ID. Retrieve a list of employees ordered by department name, and within each department ordered alphabetically in descending order by last name.
SELECT E.F_NAME, E.L_NAME, D.DEP_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES AS E, DEPARTMENTS AS D
WHERE E.DEP_ID = D.DEPT_ID_DEP
ORDER BY D.DEP_NAME, E.L_NAME DESC;

--Exercise 3: Grouping
--For each department ID retrieve the number of employees in the department.
SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEES 
GROUP BY DEP_ID;

--For each department retrieve the number of employees in the department, and the average employee salary in the department..
SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*), AVG(SALARY)
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEP_ID;

--Label the computed columns in the result set of SQL problem 2 (Exercise 3 Problem 2) as NUM_EMPLOYEES and AVG_SALARY.
SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*) AS "NUM_EMPLOYEES", AVG(SALARY) AS "AVG_SALARY"
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEP_ID;

--In SQL problem 3 (Exercise 3 Problem 3), order the result set by Average Salary..
SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*) AS "NUM_EMPLOYEES", AVG(SALARY) AS "AVG_SALARY"
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEP_ID
ORDER BY AVG_SALARY;

--In SQL problem 4 (Exercise 3 Problem 4), limit the result to departments with fewer than 4 employees.
SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*) AS "NUM_EMPLOYEES", AVG(SALARY) AS "AVG_SALARY"
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEP_ID
HAVING COUNT(*)<4
ORDER BY AVG_SALARY;

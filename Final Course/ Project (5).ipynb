    "Copenhagen is the capital and most populous city of Denmark. The city is also reputed to be the happiest city in the world. I will do an exchange academic semester in Copenhagen during the next semester and would like to gain a better understanding of the city facilities. I found that choosing a neighborhood to live in can be a complicated task to do, but with the help of location data from Foursquare, it could be a little bit easier."
